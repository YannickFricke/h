h (for personalized help files)


-> h2

Overview

This goal of this project is to make a simple command
called `h`` that runs from the command line. It displays
the content of text files. The idea is to make 
little cheatsheets and get to them quickly via:

-> code
>> bash

h whatever

-> h2

Current Status


-> todo 

[x] store files in `~/.h-files`` 

[x] show `~/.h-files/default.txt`` if no arguments
are passed to the command

[] show a file if an argument with the same name
is passed (e.g. `h whatever`` displays 
`~/.h-files/whatever.txt``

[] allow for any file extension to be used in
the source files

[] lists out all files if the `h`` command is
run by itself

[] setup a way to open the files in an editor
